# Bike Sharing Case Study
We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

- This case study is based on Predictive Analytics and Linear Regression(Machine Learning)
- It also consists of a seperate pdf file that has answers to all the subjective questions that were given to us as part of the assignment.

# Business Problem :
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- Day.csv, the dataset provided by the BoomBikes has been used to analyse and build the model.



## Conclusions
- Tempearture (Temp), weathersit_Lightrain_thunderstrom (Season 3), year (yr) are top 3 predictor of the dependent variable cnt. These variables influences the bike rentals the most.
- Temperature has positive effect on bike rental.
- Light snow and rain has negative impact on people from renting out the bikes
- Bike rental will go up/increase in the subsequent year.
- We can conclude that company should give weightage to these three variables while planning to achieve maximum bike rental bookings.
- High temperature & pleasant weather are ideal for bike booking so it is recommended that bike availability and promotions to be increased during summer months to further increase bike rentals.
- Company should focus on increasing the bike counts and servicing them when the weather is not pleasant so as to be prepared for the boom season.
- Also bike bookings are maximum in September month so company should keep this in mind to further increase the bike rentals and should focus more on their stratergy for this month.
- When the situation improves after the pandemic the bike rentals will go up as the trend is incresing in the subsequent years.
